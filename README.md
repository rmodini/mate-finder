### Language

Little flag at the top right to switch languages (between English and Spanish).

### Admin Page

There is also a super secret route that only an authorized admin can log in. There the admin can see new location proposals sent by users, and accept or decline it according to guidelines and common sense.

### Report

Last but noe least, users can send to the admin messages, reports or comments about anything by clicking on the Report button. For example if they find a false selling point or come across a bug. Or maybe simple they want to say hi to the admin.
